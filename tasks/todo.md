### High Priority - Ready for Implementation
- [ ] **SETUP-002: Brand-Compliant Component Library** (Current Priority)
  - [ ] Create Button components (Coral for adoption, Teal for services)
  - [ ] Implement Card components with Pet Love Community styling
  - [ ] Build Form components with design system colors
  - [ ] Create Navigation with brand colors (Active: Coral, Inactive: Text Gray)
  - [ ] Error boundary integration with design system styling
  
*Note: CLAUDE.md defines SETUP-002 differently as "API Integration & Reliability" but most of that work (RTK Query, transaction-aware client, etc.) was completed in SETUP-001. This SETUP-002 focuses on the UI component library which is the current priority.*
