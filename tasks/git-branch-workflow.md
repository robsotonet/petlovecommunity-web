# Git Branch Workflow Plan: feature/setup-001

## Current Repository Status
- **Remote:** `https://github.com/robsotonet/petlovecommunity-web.git`
- **Current Branch:** `main`
- **Status:** Up to date with origin/main
- **Working Tree:** Clean (no uncommitted changes)

---

## **Branch Creation & Synchronization Work Plan**

### **SETUP-001: Feature Branch Creation & GitHub Sync** 
*Goal: Create feature/setup-001 branch for enterprise foundation development*

#### **Step 1: Pre-Branch Validation** âœ…
- [x] **Repository Status Check** 
  - Confirmed remote: `origin` â†’ `github.com/robsotonet/petlovecommunity-web.git`
  - Current branch: `main`
  - Working tree: Clean
  - Up to date with `origin/main`

#### **Step 2: Feature Branch Creation**
- [ ] **Create and switch to feature branch**
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/setup-001
  ```
  - Creates new branch `feature/setup-001` from current `main`
  - Automatically switches to the new branch
  - Branch naming follows enterprise convention: `feature/[task-id]`

#### **Step 3: Initial Branch Push & Upstream Setup**  
- [ ] **Push branch to GitHub with upstream tracking**
  ```bash
  git push -u origin feature/setup-001
  ```
  - `-u` flag sets upstream tracking for the branch
  - Enables `git push` and `git pull` without specifying remote/branch
  - Creates branch on GitHub remote repository

#### **Step 4: Branch Validation**
- [ ] **Verify branch creation and tracking**
  ```bash
  git branch -vv
  git status
  ```
  - Confirms `feature/setup-001` is active branch
  - Verifies upstream tracking is configured
  - Shows clean working tree on new branch

## **Development Workflow on feature/setup-001**

### **Enterprise Development Standards**
Following CLAUDE.md enterprise workflow requirements:

#### **Commit Standards**
- **Correlation ID Integration:** Each commit includes correlation context
- **Task Reference:** Commits reference SETUP-001 task items  
- **Enterprise Format:**
  ```
  feat(setup-001): implement design system integration
  
  - Configure Tailwind with Pet Love Community colors
  - Set up CSS custom properties for brand palette
  - Create base Button and Card component foundations

  ```

#### **Branch Protection & Sync Strategy**
- **Regular Sync:** Keep feature branch updated with main
- **Atomic Commits:** Each logical change as separate commit
- **Task Tracking:** Mark todo items complete as commits are made

### **Sync Commands for Development**

#### **Daily Sync with Main** (Recommended)
```bash
# Fetch latest from main
git fetch origin main

# Switch to main and pull latest
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Switch back to feature branch and rebase
git checkout feature/setup-001
git rebase main

# Push updated branch (force with lease for safety)
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/setup-001
```

#### **Alternative: Merge Strategy** (If rebasing is complex)
```bash
# From feature/setup-001 branch
git fetch origin main
git merge origin/main
git push origin feature/setup-001
```

## **GitHub Integration & Collaboration**

### **Branch Visibility**
- **GitHub Branch:** `feature/setup-001` will be visible in repository
- **Pull Request Ready:** Branch ready for PR creation when development complete
- **Team Collaboration:** Other developers can checkout and collaborate

### **GitHub Actions Integration**
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Branch will trigger automated testing
- **Design System Validation:** Automated checks for brand compliance
- **Enterprise Quality Gates:** Lint, typecheck, test coverage validation

### **Documentation Sync**
- **Task Updates:** Update `tasks/todo.md` as work progresses
- **Sprint Log:** Daily updates to `tasks/sprint-log.md`
- **Architecture Decisions:** Document technical choices in `tasks/architecture-decisions.md`

---

## **Execution Plan & Timeline**

### **Immediate Actions (Next 5 minutes)**
1. **Create feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/setup-001
   ```

2. **Push and set upstream**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/setup-001
   ```

3. **Verify setup**
   ```bash
   git status
   git branch -vv
   ```

### **Development Flow (Starting immediately after branch creation)**
- **Begin SETUP-001 implementation** on feature branch
- **Regular commits** following enterprise standards
- **Task tracking** via todo.md updates
- **Daily sync** with main branch if needed

### **Branch Lifecycle**
- **Development Phase:** Implement SETUP-001 tasks (Days 1-10)
- **Testing Phase:** Validate enterprise patterns and design system
- **Review Phase:** Prepare for pull request to main
- **Integration Phase:** Merge via PR after review

## **Commands Summary**

### **Branch Creation Workflow**
```bash
# 1. Create and switch to feature branch
git checkout -b feature/setup-001

# 2. Push branch to GitHub with upstream tracking  
git push -u origin feature/setup-001

# 3. Verify branch setup
git status
git branch -vv
```

### **Development Workflow**
```bash
# Daily work cycle
git status                          # Check working tree
git add .                           # Stage changes
git commit -m "feat(setup-001): ..." # Commit with task reference
git push                            # Push to feature branch

# Periodic sync with main
git fetch origin main               # Get latest main
git rebase origin/main              # Rebase feature on main
git push --force-with-lease         # Update remote feature branch
```

## **Risk Mitigation**

### **Branch Protection**
- **Force-with-lease:** Prevents accidentally overwriting others' work
- **Regular Backups:** Feature branch exists on GitHub remote
- **Clean Working Tree:** Start with clean state to avoid conflicts

### **Collaboration Safety**
- **Upstream Tracking:** Proper remote branch configuration
- **Atomic Commits:** Logical, reviewable changes
- **Task Documentation:** Clear progress tracking in tasks/ folder

### **Recovery Procedures**
- **Branch Reset:** Can reset to any commit if needed
- **Main Fallback:** Can always return to main branch
- **GitHub Backup:** Remote branch serves as backup
