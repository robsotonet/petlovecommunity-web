# Pet Love Community - Architecture Decisions Record (ADR)

## ADR Template
Each decision follows this format:
- **Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Superseded
- **Context:** What is the issue we're trying to solve?  
- **Decision:** What we decided to do
- **Consequences:** What becomes easier/harder as a result

---

## ADR-001: State Management Architecture
*Date: 2025-01-07*  
*Status: Accepted*

**Context:**
Need enterprise-grade state management that supports correlation IDs, transaction tracking, and real-time SignalR integration with the .NET backend.

**Decision:** 
Use Redux Toolkit + RTK Query with custom enterprise middleware for:
- Correlation ID injection on all actions
- Transaction state management  
- Idempotency tracking
- SignalR event handling

**Consequences:**
✅ **Easier:** Enterprise tracing, state predictability, time-travel debugging  
⚠️ **Harder:** Initial setup complexity, learning curve for team

**Implementation Notes:**
```typescript
// Custom middleware stack
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer,
  middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) =>
    getDefaultMiddleware()
      .concat(correlationMiddleware)
      .concat(transactionMiddleware) 
      .concat(idempotencyMiddleware)
      .concat(signalRMiddleware)
})
```

## ADR-002: Real-time Communication Strategy
*Date: 2025-01-07*  
*Status: Accepted*

**Context:**
Need real-time updates for pet availability, adoption status, event RSVPs, and social interactions. Must integrate seamlessly with existing .NET SignalR backend.

**Decision:**
Use @microsoft/signalr with automatic reconnection, connection pooling, and Redux integration for state synchronization.

**Consequences:**
✅ **Easier:** Real-time UX, .NET integration, automatic state sync  
⚠️ **Harder:** Connection lifecycle management, offline handling

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Hub connection per feature area (pets, events, social)
- Automatic state invalidation on SignalR events
- Fallback to polling for critical features

---

## ADR-003: Enterprise Request Tracing
*Date: 2025-01-07*  
*Status: Accepted*

**Context:**
Need to trace every request/action across the distributed system for debugging, monitoring, and compliance. Must work with existing .NET correlation ID system.

**Decision:**
Implement correlation ID system that:
- Generates unique IDs for each user action
- Propagates through all API calls via headers
- Integrates with Redux actions and SignalR events
- Provides parent/child relationship tracking

**Consequences:**  
✅ **Easier:** Debugging, monitoring, compliance, cross-service tracing  
⚠️ **Harder:** Every action needs correlation context

**Headers Added:**
- `X-Correlation-ID`: Request tracing
- `X-Transaction-ID`: Transaction boundary
- `X-User-ID`: User context
- `X-Session-ID`: Session tracking

---

## ADR-004: Idempotency & Duplicate Prevention
*Date: 2025-01-07*  
*Status: Accepted*

**Context:**
Enterprise applications must prevent duplicate operations (double-clicks, network retries, race conditions) to maintain data integrity.

**Decision:**
Implement comprehensive idempotency system with:
- Unique idempotency keys for state-changing operations
- Client-side duplicate prevention  
- Server coordination for critical operations
- Redis-like storage for idempotency tracking

**Consequences:**
✅ **Easier:** Data consistency, user trust, error recovery  
⚠️ **Harder:** Complex operation tracking, storage requirements

**Key Operations:**
- Pet favorites/unfavorites
- Adoption applications
- Event RSVPs  
- Social interactions (likes, comments)

---

## ADR-005: Mobile-First Responsive Strategy
*Date: 2025-01-07*  
*Status: Accepted*

**Context:**
Pet adoption users primarily use mobile devices. Need responsive design that works excellently on mobile while scaling to desktop.

**Decision:**
Implement mobile-first design with Tailwind CSS breakpoint system:
- Start with mobile layouts (320px+)
- Progressive enhancement for larger screens
- Touch-optimized interactions
- Performance-focused mobile experience

**Consequences:**
✅ **Easier:** Mobile UX, performance, accessibility  
⚠️ **Harder:** Complex responsive layouts, testing matrix

**Breakpoint Strategy:**
```css
'xs': '475px',    /* Mobile large */
'sm': '640px',    /* Small tablets */  
'md': '768px',    /* Tablets */
'lg': '1024px',   /* Small desktops */
'xl': '1280px',   /* Large desktops */
```

## ADR-006: Authentication & Authorization
*Date: 2025-01-07*  
*Status: Proposed*

**Context:**
Need secure authentication that integrates with .NET backend, supports correlation tracing, and provides seamless UX.

**Decision:** 
Use NextAuth.js with:
- JWT tokens for stateless authentication
- Redux integration for client state
- Correlation ID context in auth flows
- Protected route wrapper components
- SignalR authentication state sync

**Consequences:**
✅ **Easier:** Secure auth, provider integration, session management  
⚠️ **Harder:** JWT lifecycle, correlation propagation

*Status: Needs technical validation*

---

## ADR-007: Testing Strategy  
*Date: 2025-01-07*  
*Status: Proposed*

**Context:**
Enterprise applications require comprehensive testing including enterprise features (correlation IDs, idempotency, SignalR).

**Decision:**
Multi-layered testing approach:
- **Unit:** Vitest for components and services  
- **Integration:** SignalR connection testing
- **E2E:** Playwright for complete user flows
- **Enterprise:** Correlation tracing, idempotency validation

**Consequences:**
✅ **Easier:** Confidence in releases, regression prevention  
⚠️ **Harder:** Test maintenance, complex enterprise test scenarios

*Status: Needs implementation details*

---

## ADR-008: Design System Integration Strategy
*Date: 2025-01-07*  
*Status: Accepted*

**Context:**
Pet Love Community has a comprehensive design system (design-system.json) with specific color psychology for adoption vs service actions. Need to integrate this into the technical architecture while maintaining enterprise patterns.

**Decision:**
Integrate design-system.json as the single source of truth for all UI styling:
- Coral (#FF6B6B) exclusively for adoption-related actions (emotional connection)
- Teal (#4ECDC4) exclusively for service-related actions (professional trust)
- Midnight Blue (#1A535C) for all primary text content
- Warm Beige (#F7FFF7) for main backgrounds
- Strict enforcement of color psychology rules via TypeScript types

**Consequences:**
✅ **Easier:** Consistent brand experience, emotional user journeys, accessibility compliance  
⚠️ **Harder:** Strict color usage rules, component variant complexity

**Implementation Strategy:**
```typescript
// Component variants enforce design system rules
type ButtonVariant = 'adoption' | 'service' | 'secondary'

// Adoption buttons MUST use coral
<Button variant="adoption">Adopt Me</Button>  // ✅ Coral

// Service buttons MUST use teal  
<Button variant="service">Book Service</Button>  // ✅ Teal
```

**Color Psychology Enforcement:**
- TypeScript types prevent incorrect color usage
- Component library abstracts color decisions
- Design system compliance testing in CI/CD
