## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### **Enterprise Patterns (Every Feature)**
1. **Correlation ID Tracing:** Every request/action gets unique correlation ID
2. **Idempotency:** All state-changing operations are idempotent
3. **Transaction Management:** Complex workflows use transaction patterns  
4. **Real-time Updates:** SignalR for live data synchronization
5. **Mobile-First:** Responsive design across all breakpoints (320px-768px-1024px+)
6. **Design System Compliance:** Strict adherence to Pet Love Community brand colors and patterns

### **Design System Standards**
- **Coral (#FF6B6B):** Adoption-related actions, emotional connections, favorites
- **Teal (#4ECDC4):** Service bookings, secondary actions, professional features  
- **Midnight Blue (#1A535C):** All primary text, headings, professional content
- **Warm Beige (#F7FFF7):** Main backgrounds, comfortable reading areas
- **Accessibility:** WCAG AA compliance (all color combinations exceed 4.5:1 contrast)
- **60-30-10 Rule:** 60% beige backgrounds, 30% midnight text, 10% coral/teal accents

### **Performance Standards**
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.2s
- Bundle size: < 180KB initial load
- SignalR connection: < 500ms
- 90%+ test coverage
- TypeScript strict mode
- Design system CSS variables for consistent theming

### **Development Workflow**
1. **Planning:** Update todo.md with detailed tasks
2. **Design Review:** Verify component designs match design-system.json specifications
3. **Implementation:** Follow enterprise patterns + design system compliance
4. **Brand Validation:** Ensure proper color usage (coral for adoption, teal for services)
5. **Testing:** Unit + integration tests + visual regression tests
6. **Review:** Add to reviews.md with metrics + design system compliance
7. **Documentation:** Update CLAUDE.md if patterns change
